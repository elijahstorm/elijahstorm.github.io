  <h3>Quarantine Reservation System <a href="http://gguest.kr/"><i class="fa fa-link portfolio-ease w3-hover-opacity port-hidden"></i></a></h3>
  <h6>
    Created an online reservation booking system for a government mandated
    quarantine facility in South Korea. I used different REST APIs and managed
    user traffic and implemented sales through the website for the ultimate user
    experience. Successfully managing a high volume of customer's needs and
    designing the website to be easily accessible and understandable to
    foreigners entering into the country and needing to mandatorily quarantine.
    <br />
    <br />
    Converting the users to the checkout page, and using PayPal to conduct sales
    through the website and send reservation data back to our internal systems.

    Easy Ai Development Team Management System. Our idea was to make clean and easy
    software that will rival big companies in the manufacturing of Visual AI
    data. Our systems will allow team managers to easily program and edit
    AI Training data without the need of an expensive Engineer and Education
    fees.
    <br />
    <br />
    Our AI is using Firebase for data storing and user-base management. the
    goal is to make this software able to software the one-stop management
    solution for companies to train their Visual AI systems without the
    complexity of the existing models. Hopefully people can use this technology
    to streamline their own development and creation in the world, so we can
    take advantage that the beauty that AI Systems can bring, without excluding
    who can do it to the Educated Engineers.

    I learned a lot about how to manage the work-flow of huge data-focused
    projects, and seamless streaming of that live data across all platforms
    (APIs, mobile, iOS, android, web, etc). The most important thing to me was
    making the process of future work easier, because I knew a project of this
    scope could become massive very quickly. Making a scalable data management
    system that had a very high-level API use, to allow the developers who work
    after me an easy time developing and maintaining key features.

  <h3>Arrival App (team of 10) <a href="/showcase/arrival/"><i class="fa fa-link portfolio-ease w3-hover-opacity port-hidden"></i></a></h3>
  <h6>
    An app I developed with for a startup company in Kansas City, Missouri,
    USA. The mission of the app was to create a virtual mall space in response
    to the pandemic shutting down public meetups and local businesses. The app
    seamlessly integrates a sales and local-business showcase while providing
    a place for friends to socialize and virtually meetup. An online mall!
    <br />
    <br />
    I left the project because I was hired to work a salary job at another
    app company in Kansas City, Missouri. That company goes by the name of Peep
    Connect. These screenshots showcase the working status of the Arrival app when
    I left. I am no longer responsible for the current happenings at Arrival,
    but we are still good friends. (I just don't live in the USA anymore! haha)
