    A relatively simple AI test project I made just to experiment with AI.
    As a long time avid chess player, I've always wanted to break down and
    figure out how Chess Engines worked. I am currently creating this as a
    side project, and I expect to be done by May 24th - 31th.
    <br />
    <br />
    Using iterative deepening and advanced pruning techniques, the AI engine
    currently picks what it thinks is the best move, while looking 6 moves
    ahead in 100ms (suprisingly impressive speeds); however, my evaluate function
    is not as accurate as I would like. This chess AI by no means boasts being
    the best in the world, and will most likely fall to an engine like Stockfish.
    <br />
    <br />
    I recently redeigned the interface, and used multi-threaded, delayed computation
    to provide a smoother user experience and allow a beautifully integrated Evaluation
    bar that will act and adjust even on the Players turn. Before, the CPU intensive search
    function would lock the page until it finished searching the millions of lines that
    it might need to get a clear idea of the position before moving. Again, I was
    suprised by how well the results turned out, because I was worried it would
    delay the Search function by so much that it would be agonizingly slow. However,
    there was little to no noticable slowdown issue from having the Multi-Threaded Delay Search
    approach, to not having it.
    <br />
    <br />
    My next current goal is to evaulate down unstable capturing lines so that
    the horizion effect of heuristic AI does not affect my engine as much.
    My biggest roadblock is fine-tuning the heatmaps and tactic evaulations.
    A good chess player will have a good understanding of tactics, and my AI
    just brute forces evaulations, and therefore misses tactics and processes
    them slowly.
    <br />
    <br />
    I usually work this in my free time, so it's a bit slow to
    finish :)

  <h3>Game - ThunderLite (Solo) <a href="https://thunderlite.herokuapp.com/"><i class="fa fa-link portfolio-ease w3-hover-opacity port-hidden"></i></a></h3>
  <h6>
    This is a live, online, multiplayer game that I created back in 2018 based
    off of a slightly popular online game from the late 2000s that I played.
    I was always fascinated how the game worked and I wanted to recreate it,
    but never got around to it until after High School. The original game
    has long since been abandoned by its creators, and the community fell
    apart. I thought it would be a fun and harmless project to recreate
    something I once found so much joy in!
    <br />
    <br />
    Coded entirely in HTML5, JavaScript and Node.js, I didn't stop at making
    the game and it's Engine. I decided to make a user database and include
    user profiles, with custom information and details! Also a fun level-up
    system. I used MongoDB and Socket.io to make a live playable game that was
    cross-platform for mobile and desktop users. I also created an AI that
    actively found great moves and kept the offline play interesting as well!
