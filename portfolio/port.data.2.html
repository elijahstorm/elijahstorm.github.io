  <h3>Musical Projects (team of 3) <a href="showcase/music"><i class="fa fa-link portfolio-ease w3-hover-opacity port-hidden"></i></a></h3>
  <h6>
    Here are a few musical projects I made over the past few years. Each project
    is near and dear to my heart, and took many months or even years to complete.
    There is a link to a compilation of some of them so you can listen!
    I wrote the songs and did all the production from my home studio. I
    recorded all of it on equipment I bought myself. It was so fun to create!

  <h3>Collabrative Photography (team of 2)</h3>
  <h6>
    On a trip to Los Angeles in 2016, a high school friend of mine and I decided
    to do a collaborative project. We took many pictures and edited them, then
    found the best 12 and tied them to a musical project. One track represents
    one picture. This was something we had a lot of fun with, and kick-started
    my ambitions and desires to work on big projects moving forward into the future.
    I loved the satisfaction of seeing something come to life and working
    with my friends to achieve a common goal that would be impossible by myself.
    <br />
    <br />
    We have physical copies of all the albums and artwork printed from CD Baby.
    Super fun!
