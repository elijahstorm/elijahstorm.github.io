        I have dedicated my life to studying programming and software
        development. I have a strong passion for website and interest for all
        kinds of Ai development. Ever since back in high school, when I
        developed my first Ai projects, I've always been fascinated by new
        technological developments.

            Outside of private company work that I can't show the code for, I
            have some personal projects that I like to do: This project is a fun
            one! I worked with my girlfriend, who is a UX designer. I'm proud of
            this code because I love making things look pixel perfect, and
            elegant in simplicity for the user! I also am proud of myself
            because I came up with some unique solutions to handling the data to
            streamline the development process as well--making revisions and
            adding features into the future a lot easier. It's still got a bit
            more work to be finished, but it's 90% done.
            <br />
            <br />
            I worked in Flutter to make a cross-platform app that felt extremely
            simple to use. As well as an equal, separate web client written in
            SvelteKit for handling sharing/linking data so users can quickly
            share their content with anyone on the web--even if they don't have
            the app downloaded. Using Firebase for Authentication, Firestore for
            data, and Cloud Storage for media uploads.
            <br />
            <br />
            The idea was to make an app that felt as light as a feather to use,
            but had a lot of sturdy features and customization. As well as
            integrates a social element that is non-competitive to mainstream
            social apps, but can work as as a nice addition to peoples' daily
            lives. We wanted to provide a simple place for users to share their
            daily life, their accomplishments, or work together and put plans in
            motion with their friends using our teams feature!

            I'm in the process of updating this project to Flutter 3.0, and then
            releasing to the Apple and Android app stores, and Windows, Linux,
            MacOS clients. Flutter allows a single codebase to work as the
            framework for all of these platforms, and you can target single
            platforms with just a bit of extra code.

            Both of these questions can be answered at once. I both love and I
            fear for the development of Ai. I think it's really impressive, the
            things that can be accomplished. However it can easily become a
            thing that can fall outside of our grasps if we don't successfully
            approach the issue with preparation. I want to make an influence
            towards that development, because I think it needs the proper
            approach to be a benefit, and not a danger, to our society.

            I've been on a lot of different teams, from small to big, and I have
            learned that a lot of approaches depend on the situation and who

            positive respect, and understanding of their situation as well.
