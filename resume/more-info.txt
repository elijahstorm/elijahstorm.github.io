A sample of code that you're particularly proud of. Why I am proud of the code.

Outside of private company work that I can't show the code for, I have some personal projects that I like to do: This project is a fun one! I worked with my girlfriend, who is a UX designer. I'm proud of this code because I love making things look pixel perfect, and elegant in simplicity for the user! I also am proud of myself because I came up with some unique solutions to handling the data to streamline the development process as well--making revisions and adding features into the future a lot easier. It's still got a bit more work to be finished, but it's 90% done.

I worked in Flutter to make a cross-platform app that felt extremely simple to use. As well as an equal, separate web client written in SvelteKit for handling sharing/linking data so users can quickly share their content with anyone on the web--even if they don't have the app downloaded. Using Firebase for Authentication, Firestore for data, and Cloud Storage for media uploads.

The idea was to make an app that felt as light as a feather to use, but had a lot of sturdy features and customization. As well as integrates a social element that is non-competitive to mainstream social apps, but can work as as a nice addition to peoples' daily lives. We wanted to provide a simple place for users to share their daily life, their accomplishments, or work together and put plans in motion with their friends using our teams feature!

I'm in the process of updating this project to Flutter 3.0, and then releasing to the Apple and Android app stores, and Windows, Linux, MacOS clients. Flutter allows a single codebase to work as the framework for all of these platforms, and you can target single platforms with just a bit of extra code.

A sample of your technical writing.

About a month or two ago, I noticed an issue when working on a React Component Library for my current employer. I was adding Cypress to write automatic tests the repo that run before any code changes can be published to the companies private npm. However, the latest version of Cypress was only running on React 16, and would throw errors when working on React 18 (because of peerDependencies. I made this issue to bring up testing and releasing for React 18. The issue was picked up by the team and the next release of Cypress will now include React 18, as well as making it quicker to upgrade to newer React versions in the future. I also helped do some minor testing with the new updates and caught an error, that the developers were able to add a fix for.
